This code was for the working paper "The Impact of Nurse-Led Care Coordination on Healthcare Utilisation: A Quasi-Experimental Australian Study Using Linked Electronic Health Records"
The code first formulises an analytical sample comprising of treated patients (Patients enrolled into a care-coordination program "Right Care Better Health") and a control group (patients that have been flagged as eligible to be enrolled but have not yet enrolled due to program capacity constraints, but may be enrolled in the future). After the analytical sample is constructed a more narrow matched-sample specification is also estimated using Coarsened Exact Matching (Stata Command: CEM). The final matched and unmatched samples are linked to the POLAR data from Outcome Health, which comprises of individual POLAR datasets on referrals, MBS services, and anatomical prescription codes that are individually cleaned and merged together through a unique patient identifier. The analysis runs
