This code was for the working paper "The Impact of Nurse-Led Care Coordination on Healthcare Utilisation: A Quasi-Experimental Australian Study Using Linked Electronic Health Records".
The code creates an analytical sample comprising of a treatment and control group, cleans the POLAR data and merges the analytical sample into it, and then runs an event-study difference-in-differences analysis using the estimators from de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeuille (2024), using the stata did_multiplegt_dyn command.
