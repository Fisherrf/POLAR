This code was for the working paper "The Impact of Nurse-Led Care Coordination on Healthcare Utilisation: A Quasi-Experimental Australian Study Using Linked Electronic Health Records".
The code creates an analytical sample comprising of a treatment and control group, cleans the Population Level Analysis and Reporting (POLAR) data and merges the analytical sample into it, and then runs a dynamic event-study difference-in-differences analysis.
